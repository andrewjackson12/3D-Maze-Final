This is my submission for the COSC3306 Assignment 3. I created a 3D maze for this assignment.

To set up and run this project, Vite needs to be installed, which is a local server host application. The three.js library also needs to be installed along with the FirstPersonControls, OBJLoader and MTLLoader libraries.

I structured this project along the guidelines of the official three.js documentation. This means that I have a index.html file for defining my import map and a seperate main.js file for my javascript. 

To run this project, you must navigate to the project folder in the terminal, then start a Vite local server and then use your web browser to navigate to the address that the server is being hosted at.
